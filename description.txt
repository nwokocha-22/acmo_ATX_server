We are looking to deploy some sensitive code base for some people who are looking to work remotely, 
and we need to ensure continuous monitoring and logging processes for all their activities.

I want you to figure out how to record a machine's screen - only when someone is logged in -, 
and render a video from it (the quality of which could be specified).

- The task should run as administrator, should be invisible to the user, and the user 
shouldn't be able to change or kill it,

- The video should be saved to another server that we specify via a secure protocol,

In addition, all clipboard activity needs to be logged and controlled. If someone copies
 more than 500 characters an hour, or 1500 characters a day in total, then we get emails 
 with the copied content, and using the clipboard is disabled for 24 hours (even after reboot, etc). 
 The OS is windows 2012 R2 server. Please find if there's some tool that does something similar, 
 if not then write it in python.
